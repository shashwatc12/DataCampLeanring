#List comprehensions for time-stamped data
#You will now make use of what you've learned from this chapter to solve a simple data extraction problem. You will also be introduced to a data structure, the pandas Series, in this exercise. We won't elaborate on it much here, but what you should know is that it is a data structure that you will be working with a lot of times when analyzing data from pandas DataFrames. You can think of DataFrame columns as single-dimension arrays called Series.

#In this exercise, you will be using a list comprehension to extract the time from time-stamped Twitter data. The pandas package has been imported as pd and the file 'tweets.csv' has been imported as the df DataFrame for your use.

# Extract the created_at column from df: tweet_time
tweet_time = df['created_at']

# Extract the clock time: tweet_clock_time
tweet_clock_time = [entry[11:19] for entry in tweet_time]

# Print the extracted times
print(tweet_clock_time)




#Conditional list comprehensions for time-stamped data
#Great, you've successfully extracted the data of interest, the time, from a pandas DataFrame! Let's tweak your work further by adding a conditional that further specifies which entries to select.

#In this exercise, you will be using a list comprehension to extract the time from time-stamped Twitter data. You will add a conditional expression to the list comprehension so that you only select the times in which entry[17:19] is equal to '19'. The pandas package has been imported as pd and the file 'tweets.csv' has been imported as the df DataFrame for your use.


# Extract the created_at column from df: tweet_time
tweet_time = df['created_at']

# Extract the clock time: tweet_clock_time
tweet_clock_time = [entry[11:19] for entry in tweet_time if entry[17:19] == '19']

# Print the extracted times
print(tweet_clock_time)
