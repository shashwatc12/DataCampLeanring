#Bringing it all together (2)
#Great job! You've now defined the functionality for iterating over entries in a column and building a dictionary with keys the names of languages and values the number of tweets in the given language.

#In this exercise, you will define a function with the functionality you developed in the previous exercise, return the resulting dictionary from within the function, and call the function with the appropriate arguments.

#For your convenience, the pandas package has been imported as pd and the 'tweets.csv' file has been imported into the tweets_df variable.


# Define count_entries()
def count_entries(df, col_name):
    """Return a dictionary with counts of 
    occurrences as value for each key."""

    # Initialize an empty dictionary: langs_count
    langs_count = {}
    
    # Extract column from DataFrame: col
    col = df[col_name]
    
    # Iterate over lang column in DataFrame
    for entry in col:

        # If the language is in langs_count, add 1
        if entry in langs_count.keys():
            langs_count[entry]+=1
        # Else add the language to langs_count, set the value to 1
        else:
            langs_count[entry]=1

    # Return the langs_count dictionary
    return langs_count

# Call count_entries(): result
result=count_entries(tweets_df,'lang')

# Print the result
print(result)
